# Base URL for the Django API. When running both projects locally, the
# Django development server typically runs on http://localhost:8000. The
# API is served under the /api prefix, so do not include /api here.
#
# For example:
# VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/api

VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/api
